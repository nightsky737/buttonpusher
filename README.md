# Info
Here, you have a multiplayer game where you have to hold a certain subset of the buttons at once. Each player can only click/hold one button.

The game communicates over multiple devices and challenges the player to find the right three numbers and press them at the same time in order to complete the level before the time runs out. Meant for 3+ people.

Use your mouse to press the buttons. The ids of the buttons that needs to be pressed at once are visible on the top right.

Press any number on your keyboard and then "restart" to make a new game with that number of buttons that needs to be pressed.
